# DJCrowd

Produced by Adam Keefer, Karl Zhu, Max Mossberg, and Sam Hild at MHacks 11 - October 12, 2018.

DJCrowd is an open-source Android Application that interfaces with Spotify and your phone number to bring crowd-sourced music to your event!

Guests get a phone number passed to them to text song requests to in the form <artist name>, <track name>.
The host signs into the app using their spotify credentials, connecting to whatever device the host has their spotify account open on.
The controller collects song request data via text messages and will play the most highly-requested song within a small period of time.
